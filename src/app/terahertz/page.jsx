                        <h3>What is Terahertz Therapy?</h3>
                        <p>Terahertz therapy is an advanced, non-invasive wellness technology that harnesses the power of terahertz frequenciesâ€”situated between microwaves and infrared on the electromagnetic spectrum. These frequencies resonate with human cells, stimulating their natural healing processes. Terahertz waves penetrate deep into the body, improving circulation, oxygenation, and cellular repair while promoting detoxification. This groundbreaking therapy is designed to support overall well-being by restoring balance, reducing inflammation, and enhancing the body&apos;s natural ability to heal itself.</p>

It is especially beneficial for individuals with conditions such as arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, and other imbalances that impact daily life.
